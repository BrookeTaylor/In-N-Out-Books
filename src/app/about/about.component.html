    <h1 class="blue">About</h1>

<p>This project was originally developed during a Web 425 Angular course as a hands-on introduction to Angular’s component architecture, service-based data handling, and client-side routing. The first version featured a basic display of static book data in a card layout.</p>

Now updated to the latest version of Angular, this app includes:
<ul>
  <li>A refreshed selection of books with updated details</li>
  <li>An improved user interface with enhanced styling and responsiveness</li>
  <li>A reimagined theme to match a more polished and immersive user experience</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of this app was to demonstrate dynamic UI rendering, modular structure, and scalable design patterns — all with a touch of personality. Whether you’re browsing, dreaming, or just testing features, In-N-Out Books invites you into a space where reading, design, and code meet.</p>
